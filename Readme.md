## About Texas Hold'em Poker

Poker is a family of card games where players wager over which hand is best according to specific rules. While there are many variations, some aspects are common to all poker games. Here's a breakdown of the general rules:

### 1. Basic Gameplay

Objective: To win the "pot," which is the accumulated bets from all players in a single hand. This can be achieved by having the best hand at the "showdown" (where players reveal their hands) or by making all other players fold (give up).
Betting Rounds: Most poker games involve multiple betting rounds, where players have the option to:
Bet: Place an initial wager.
Call: Match the current bet.
Raise: Increase the current bet.
Fold: Forfeit the hand and any bets already placed.
### 2. Hand Rankings

Poker hands are ranked according to their probability, with the rarest hands being the highest. Here's a common ranking from highest to lowest:

- **Royal Flush:** A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit.
- Straight Flush: Five cards in sequence, all of the same suit.
- **Four of a Kind:** Four cards of the same rank.
- **Full House:** Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.
- **Flush:** Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.
- **Straight:** Five cards in sequence, not all of the same suit.   
- **Three of a Kind:** Three cards of the same rank.
- Two Pair: Two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.
- One Pair: Two cards of the same rank.
- **High Card:** If no other hand is formed, the highest card wins.   

### 3. Key Terms

**Blinds**: Forced bets placed by players to the left of the dealer to initiate betting.

**Dealer**: The player who distributes the cards. In casino games, a house dealer handles this.

**Pot**: The total amount of money bet during a hand.

**Showdown**: The final stage where remaining players reveal their hands to determine the winner.
